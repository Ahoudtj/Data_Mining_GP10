```{r Data Exploration}
# Data is broken down by customer.
TRAIN[which(TRAIN$Customer_ID == 3392),]
# Each customer looks to have 8 months worth of credit data
test <- TRAIN %>% group_by(Customer_ID) %>%  summarise(numObservations = n())
table(test$numObservations)


# The TRAIN dataset has an extra column (Credit_Score). This appears to be the variable that we will be predicting with the HOLDOUT data.
colnames(TRAIN)[which(colnames(TRAIN)!=colnames(HOLDOUT))]

# Checking for NAs in both datasets
Train_NA <- sapply(TRAIN, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y))))) 
data.frame(Train_NA) # No NAs in the TRAINING data

Holdout_NA <- sapply(HOLDOUT, function(y) sum(length(which(is.na(y))))) 
data.frame(Holdout_NA) # No NAs in the HOLDOUT data
```

Some questions to think about:

-Data is designed to predict credit score (good, bad, standard).

-What determines if a client qualifies for a credit card loan?

-Does payment behavior correlate with loan acceptance?

-How does bad credit affect loan acceptance?

-How does occupation affect credit scores?

```{r Data Cleaning}
